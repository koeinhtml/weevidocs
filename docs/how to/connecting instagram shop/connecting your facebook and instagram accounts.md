There are a lot of reasons why you might want to share access to your company's Instagram account with your digital marketing agency.

1.  You want your agency to run ads for your business on Instagram.
2.  You'd like your agency to boost some of your Instagram posts to achieve specific marketing objectives.
3.  You want your agency to create content and post directly to your feed.

Instagram advertising is handled through Facebook Ads. So, you can achieve the first two objectives by sharing access through Facebook Business Manager. In the third case, you will need to share your company's Instagram account password with your agency or else give them access through a third-party tool like Hootsuite or Buffer.

We've put together this blog post to walk through the steps in each scenario and provided screenshots to make it easy to follow. So, if you are ready to begin sharing Instagram access with your agency, but haven't known how to get started, you've found the right resource. 

Link with Your Facebook Page
----------------------------

First, you need to link your business Instagram account with a Facebook Page that you manage - presumably the Page for the same business that the Instagram account represents. You can do this from the Instagram app on your phone, as described in [this Instagram help article](https://help.instagram.com/356902681064399). Here's how I linked the Megalytic Instagram account to our Page.

Configure Your Facebook Business Manager to Share Instagram
-----------------------------------------------------------

You use Facebook Business Manager to authorize your agency to advertise with your Instagram account. This includes running ads that use your Instagram account to represent your business and also boosting posts in your Instagram feed.

To start off, the Facebook Page that you have linked with your company Instagram account needs to be [added to your Facebook Business Manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/720478807965744). Check under Business Settings > Accounts > Pages. Here is how the Megalytic Page appears in our Facebook Business Manager:

Next, you need to add your [agency as a Partner in Facebook Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1717412048538897). To do that, your agency needs to give you their Facebook Business Manager ID. They can find that ID in their Facebook Business Manager account under Business Settings > Business Info.

In this post, we are going to use an agency named Rare Karma as our example. Here's how Rare Karma looked up their Business Manager ID so that they could share it with Megalytic.
